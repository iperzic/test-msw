# Testing the mock service worker

This project was ejected from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), plus mock-service worker installed as POC.

Setup for NodeJS intercepting is done in [scripts/start.js](scripts/start.js#L17-L25), while MSW server is started on line [153](scripts/start.js#L153).

The API call to be mocked is in [src/App.js](src/App.js#L7)
